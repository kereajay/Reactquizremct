## Code Explanation

### `Quiz` Component

- **Imports**: 
  - `useState` and `useRef` from React.
  - `data` from a local `Data.js` file containing quiz questions and options.

- **State Variables**:
  - `currentQuestion`, `clickedOption`, `score`, `showColors`, `wrongquestion`, and `displaywrongquestion` are used to manage the application's state.

- **Event Handlers**:
  - `handleQuestionChange`: Handles the transition to the next question, updates the score, and toggles color feedback.
  - `updateScore`: Updates the score based on the selected option and stores incorrectly answered questions.

- **Rendering**:
  - Displays the current question and options.
  - Provides feedback on the selected option's correctness.
  - At the end of the quiz, displays the questions that were answered incorrectly along with the correct answers.

## Styling

- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling the components.

## Example Data Format

The `data.js` file should export an array of question objects, each with the following structure:

```js
export const data = [
    {
        question: "What is the capital of the USA?",
        options: ["New York", "Los Angeles", "Washington D.C.", "Chicago"],
        answer: 3
    },
    // More questions...
];
